Privacy Policy for Beat My Best (Me Vs Me)

Last updated: January 2025

Thank you for using Beat My Best (Me Vs Me), a motivation-driven fitness and performance app designed to help users track progress, build better habits, and compete with themselves or friends. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what information the app collects, how it is used, and how it is protected.

1. Information We Collect

Beat My Best collects only the information necessary to operate core functionality and optional competitive features.

1.1. Username / Nickname

Users create a nickname/username to participate in Competitive Mode.

A default anonymous username (e.g., Player4821) is automatically generated.

Users may create a custom username.

Users should not enter their full legal name.

Usernames may be visible to friends or competitive participants.

Usernames are stored securely in our backend.

1.2. Profile Picture (Optional)

Users may upload a profile picture from their device.

Only the specific selected photo is accessed.

The app does not scan the entire photo library.

Profile photos may be visible to friends or other users only when social features are enabled.

Users may update or remove their profile photo at any time.

1.3. Performance Metrics (Optional for Competitive Mode)

When participating in online competition or friend leaderboards, users may share:

Streaks

Scores

Challenge completions

Personal bests

Leaderboard rankings

Manual entries create intrinsic accountability — every achievement is earned and recorded by the user.

Users in local-only mode do not share metrics externally.

1.4. Contacts (Optional, with Backend Matching)

Users may grant permission to access their phone contacts in order to find friends who are also using the app.

When contacts permission is granted:

The app reads names and phone numbers from the user’s contact list.

The app sends hashed or encrypted representations of this contact data to our backend solely for matching purposes (to check which contacts also use the app).

The app does not upload or store the full address book in plain form.

The data is not used for any purpose beyond matching.

The app does not permanently store the user’s contact list.

Contacts are never shared with other users or third parties.

This feature is optional and may be disabled at any time.

1.5. Cloud / Backend Data

With backend enabled, the following may be stored securely in the cloud:

Username

Profile photo (optional)

Metrics used in Competitive Mode

Friend connections

Leaderboard results

No sensitive personal data is collected.

1.6. In-App Purchases

Apple may provide device identifiers to validate purchases.
These identifiers are handled entirely by Apple and are not visible to us.

2. Information We Do NOT Collect

Beat My Best does not collect or store:

Full legal names

Emails

Phone numbers (except hashed for contact matching)

GPS/location

Messages

Health/medical data

Biometrics

Advertising identifiers

Analytics or behavioral tracking data

We do not use ad networks, analytics SDKs, or third-party tracking.

3. How Information Is Used

Information is used to:

Enable global Competitive Mode

Display leaderboard results

Facilitate friend matching

Track streaks and progress

Customize user profiles

We do not sell or rent user data.

4. Sharing With Others

Depending on user settings, the following may be visible to others:

Username

Profile photo (optional)

Streaks, scores, and metrics

Leaderboard ranking

Users control:

Whether they appear on leaderboards

Whether their profile picture is visible

Whether friend features are enabled

Whether contacts permission is granted

Local-only mode keeps all information private.

User-Initiated Social Sharing

Users may manually share screenshots or achievements to their personal social media accounts.

This sharing is:

User-initiated only

Performed through the device’s share sheet

Never collected or transmitted by the app

Users are responsible for content shared externally.

5. Future Features

Future updates may add:

Friend groups

Team competitions

Private challenges

Enhanced social profiles

All new social features will require explicit user consent.

6. Security

We use secure cloud infrastructure and iOS system protections to safeguard user data.

Security measures include:

Only accessing the chosen profile photo

Never scanning the full photo library

Encrypting cloud data in transit and at rest

Protecting leaderboard data

Not collecting sensitive personal information

Relying on Apple to handle financial data

Although no system is entirely secure, we maintain strong security best practices.

7. Children’s Privacy

Beat My Best does not knowingly collect personal information from children.
Parental guidance is recommended when minors use competitive or social features.
