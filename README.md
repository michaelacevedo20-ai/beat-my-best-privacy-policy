Privacy Policy for Beat My Best (Me Vs Me)

Last updated: January 2025

Thank you for using Beat My Best (Me Vs Me) — a motivation-driven fitness and performance app designed to help users build better habits, track their progress, and create intrinsic accountability through manual data entry and optional competitive features.

Your privacy is extremely important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what information the app collects, how it is used, and how it is protected.

1. Information We Collect

Beat My Best collects only the information required to operate core features and optional Competitive Mode.

1.1. Username / Nickname

To participate in Competitive Mode, users create a username.

A default anonymous username is generated (e.g., Player4821).

Users may choose a custom username.

Users should not enter their full legal name.

Usernames may be visible to friends or competitive participants.

Usernames are stored securely in our backend.

1.2. Profile Picture (Optional — Stored on Device Only)

Users may optionally choose a profile photo from their device.

Important:

Only the selected photo is accessed.

The app does not scan or read the entire photo library.

Profile photos are stored locally on the device only.

Profile photos are never uploaded, transmitted, or stored in the backend.

Users may update or remove their profile photo at any time.

1.3. Performance Metrics

Users may manually enter metrics such as:

Streaks

Scores

Personal bests

Manual entries create intrinsic accountability, ensuring each achievement is earned and recorded by the user.

Users in local-only mode do not share metrics with others.

1.4. Contacts (Optional — Matching Only)

Users may optionally grant permission to access their phone contacts in order to find friends who also use Beat My Best.

When permission is granted:

The app reads names and phone numbers from the user’s contact list.

Only hashed/encrypted versions of contact numbers are transmitted to the backend.

This data is used exclusively to check which contacts also use Beat My Best.

No plain-text contact lists are stored.

Contacts are never visible to other users.

Contacts are never used for analytics, advertising, or third-party sharing.

Users can disable this feature at any time.

If the permission is not granted, no contacts are accessed.
