Privacy Policy for Beat My Best (Me Vs Me)

Last updated: December 2025

Thank you for using Beat My Best (Me Vs Me) — a motivation-driven fitness and performance app designed to help users build better habits, track personal progress, and create intrinsic accountability through manual metrics entry and optional competitive features.

Your privacy is extremely important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what information the app collects, how it is used, and how it is protected.

1. Information We Collect

Beat My Best collects only the information required to operate core features and optional Competitive Mode.

1.1. Username / Nickname

Users create a nickname to participate in Competitive Mode.

We generate a default anonymous username (e.g., Player4821).

Users may customize their username.

Users should not enter their full legal name.

Usernames may be visible to friends or competitive participants.

Usernames are stored securely in our backend.

1.2. Profile Picture (Optional)

Users may upload a profile picture from their device.

Only the specific selected photo is accessed.

The app does not scan or read the full photo library.

Profile photos may be visible to friends or competitive participants (if social features are enabled).

Users may update or remove their profile photo at any time.

1.3. Performance Metrics

Users may enter metrics such as:

Streaks

Scores

Personal bests

Challenge completions

Leaderboard rankings (Competitive Mode only)

Manual entries build intrinsic accountability, allowing users to track their personal goals.

Users who remain in local-only mode do not share metrics externally.

1.4. Contacts (Optional — For Friend Matching Only)

Users may optionally grant permission to access their phone contacts so the app can match friends who also use Beat My Best.

When permission is granted:

The app reads names and phone numbers from the user’s contact list.

Contacts are processed using hashed or encrypted representations solely for the purpose of checking which contacts also use the app.

The app does not permanently store the entire contact list.

Contacts are never used for marketing, shared with third parties, or visible to other users.

This feature can be disabled at any time.

If the user does not enable this feature, no contacts are accessed.

1.5. Cloud / Backend Data

If backend features are enabled, the following may be stored securely in the cloud:

Username

Profile photo (optional)

Competitive Mode metrics

Friend connections

Leaderboard results

We do not store sensitive personal data.

1.6. In-App Purchases

Apple may supply device identifiers to validate purchases.
These identifiers are handled entirely by Apple and are not visible to us.

2. Information We Do NOT Collect

Beat My Best does not collect, store, or access:

Full legal names

Emails

GPS or precise location

Messages or chat content

Health/medical data (HealthKit, clinical records, biometrics, etc.)

Advertising identifiers (IDFA)

Behavioral analytics

Third-party advertising data

Photo libraries

Audio recordings

The app uses no advertising SDKs, no analytics SDKs, and no tracking technologies of any kind.

3. How We Use Information

We use collected information only for:

Competitive Mode

Leaderboards

Friend matching

Profile customization

Tracking streaks, goals, and progress

We do not sell, rent, or share user data with third parties.

4. Sharing With Others

Based on user settings, the following may be visible to other users:

Nickname

Profile photo (optional)

Streaks, scores, and goals

Leaderboard rankings

Users control:

Whether they appear on leaderboards

Whether their profile photo is visible

Whether friend matching is enabled

Whether contacts permission is granted

Users in local-only mode remain fully private.

5. User-Initiated Sharing

Users may manually share screenshots or achievements through their device’s native share sheet.

This is always user-initiated.

We do not access or collect shared content.

6. Future Features

Future updates may introduce:

Friend groups

Team competitions

Enhanced profiles

Private challenges

Any new features requiring additional data will require explicit user consent.

7. Security

Beat My Best uses modern security practices, including:

iOS sandbox protections

Accessing only the photo selected by the user

Encrypting cloud data in transit and at rest

Not storing sensitive personal information

Relying on Apple to handle all financial data

Despite these measures, no system is 100% secure. We consistently strive to maintain strong protections.

8. Children’s Privacy

Beat My Best does not knowingly collect personal information from children.
Parents should supervise minors using competitive or social features.

9. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this policy as features evolve. Updates will always appear at this same public URL.
